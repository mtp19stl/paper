#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements for BBOA
Particle size was measured using a PCASSP(Bloggs et al, 2004).
(Jones et al 1990 found that the caramel freddo was first seen in 1990.

# Motivations
Findout more about this important hyperinflation phenomenon.

#Simulations
We simulate the hyperinflation of freddo's over the last 33 years.

#Methodology
We compared the price of freddo's in 1987 to that in 2020. The plot was compared with the inflation levels within the same period (HMRC, 2020). 

#Conclusion
The price increases of freddo's over the last 30 years have been ridiculous.
